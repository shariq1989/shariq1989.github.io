      <description>To begin working on the blog, I needed to install Hugo first. My laptop runs Pop_OS!, a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu. There are quite a few ways to install Hugo and I chose to install the official package using apt-get.
sudo apt-get install hugo  Once the install was complete, I verified the install
hugo version  As shown in the screenshot below, Hugo version 0.74.3 installed successfully on my machine.</description>
