      <title>Find and replace text in Linux terminal, bash scripts or Jenkinsfiles</title>

      <description>I manage the build process for Android applications. Part of the process automatically updates the version of the application in various build.gradle files. In a Jenkinsfile, a list of file paths are passed into a for-loop in which the find-and-replace sed command is run to set the new version number.
Sed for Find-and-Replace Sed is a library used for performing all sorts of text operations, which makes it very handy for scripting related work.</description>

      <title>Automated image optimization for publishing on a blog</title>

      <description>After a few attempts, I have automated the process for optimizing images for JamilGhar. As my wife adds images to the project&amp;rsquo;s git repository, a bash script that runs on regular intervals will compress them. The end result is fantastic because she no longer has to wait on me to manually optimize them for her and the Raspberry Pi that sits under my desk is being very useful.
 Why is optimizing images important?</description>

      <title>Adding search functionality to a Hugo website</title>
      <link>https://shariq1989.github.io/posts/search_for_hugo/</link>

      <description>Search is an important functionality for any content heavy website. Our decision to use a static site for our recipe blog meant that adding complex features that involve server operations would be difficult to implement without relying on third-party tools. These features include comments and custom metric tracking.
 Luckily, this problem has been solved by a Javascript library called Lunr.js. Lunr provides a fast search experience for the user by processing JSON documents produced by static site generators like Hugo.</description>

      <description>At my work we use Personal Access Tokens (PATs) to authenticate to a GitHub repository (as opposed to using a password). I was having trouble cloning the repository and seeing the following error
 After browsing Stack Overflow posts, I realized that I didn&amp;rsquo;t set the right &amp;ldquo;scopes&amp;rdquo; or permissions for my token. I generated a new token but this time I made sure to set all the scopes under &amp;ldquo;repo&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>One of the most important workflows for our food recipe blog (JamilGhar) is image optimization. My wife uploads images to our GitHub repository and, when prodded, I run a bash script that decreases image sizes and removes extraneous information from the files. The script is a constant work in progress and I have a few posts (1,2) about it on here.
Lately, I have been considering downloading the repository on a Raspberry Pi and running the script as a scheduled job.</description>

      <title>Copying or Migrating a WordPress Site</title>

      <description>When my dad opened a new branch for his business, he opted for a new WordPress site which would be a copy of the site for the original location but with specific updated references like branch name, addresses and, phone numbers.
He uses GoDaddy as his host but this guide would apply to most web hosting solutions.
Copying WordPress files When migrating or copying your WordPress files, you will first need to navigate to your host&amp;rsquo;s File Manager or File Navigator.</description>

      <title>Refactoring/Find-&amp;-Replace on a WordPress site</title>

      <description>I help my dad maintain a WordPress site for his business. He recently opened a new location and needed a new WordPress site created for it. The only differences between the two sites are the branch name (ex. &amp;lsquo;Los Angeles&amp;rsquo; instead of &amp;lsquo;San Diego&amp;rsquo;) and phone number (&amp;lsquo;111-222-3333&amp;rsquo; instead of &amp;lsquo;222-333-4444&amp;rsquo;).
 The site is not stored in version control so downloading the source code, using an IDE to run find/replace and pushing updates wasn&amp;rsquo;t a straight-forward option.</description>

      <description>This blog has been a nice source of motivation to continue improving my code and development processes. In my previous post, I discussed the process of writing a Bash script to resize and optimize images for publishing to our family&amp;rsquo;s recipe blog. I mentioned that one improvement I could make is to automate the process of identifying which files needed to be resized.
The original script I place large images into the &amp;ldquo;optimize&amp;rdquo; directory which are then backed up and processed when I run the following script.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Images for the Web</title>

      <description>When we first started adding photos of food to JamilGhar, we did not think about image size. The average image we posted to the blog was between 2 and 8 megabytes and the resolution was over 3000 x 3000 pixels. The image below is an example.
 For most blogs, images should be less than 1000 pixels in the longest direction and preferably less than 100 kB. Featured or &amp;ldquo;hero&amp;rdquo; images can be up to 500 kB if used sparingly.</description>

      <title>Creating blog posts in Hugo</title>

      <description>Adding or updating posts in Hugo is easy. After all, content management is one of the framework&amp;rsquo;s primary features. My wife has little interest in understanding the software development side of blogging. Even she finds it effortless to add blog posts in markdown and half-a-dozen images per post through GitHub.
Directory structure In Hugo, posts go into the content folder which will be in the root directory of your site. Some theme&amp;rsquo;s may have varying patterns.</description>

      <description>Create a Hugo site After installing Hugo, I was ready to start on the blog. I have a directory (or &amp;ldquo;folder&amp;rdquo; for Windows folks) on my laptop for software development projects. Most of these projects are also hosted in my GitHub account.
I navigated to that directory and created a folder called food-blog. Inside food-blog, I ran Hugo&amp;rsquo;s command to start a new site.
hugo new site food-blog  In the screenshot below, you can see that the new Hugo site was created successfully.</description>

      <description>To begin working on the blog, I needed to install Hugo first. My laptop runs Pop_OS!, a Linux distribution based on Ubuntu. There are quite a few ways to install Hugo and I chose to install the official package using apt-get.
sudo apt-get install hugo  Once the installation was complete, I verified that it completed successfully.
hugo version  As shown in the screenshot below, Hugo version 0.74.3 installed successfully on my machine.</description>

      <description>My wife and I have always wanted to work on an online project together. She is creative, and I can figure out technology. A multitude of reasons pushed us to start a blog in early 2021.
 My hunger for a software-dev-related side project A desire to digitize our growing three-ring recipe binder Repeated requests for the same recipes (mostly Thai Red Curry and Butter Chicken) from friends and family  It was easy to devise requirements as we thought through different features (blog setup, adding posts and pictures, monetization, etc.</description>
