      <description>This blog has been a nice source of motivation to continue improving my code and development processes. In my previous post, I discussed the process of writing a Bash script to resize and optimize images for publishing to our family&amp;rsquo;s recipe blog. I mentioned that one improvement I could make is to automate the process of identifying which files needed to be resized.
The original script I place large images into the &amp;ldquo;optimize&amp;rdquo; directory which are then backed up and processed when I run the following script.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Images for the Web</title>

      <description>When we first started adding photos of food to JamilGhar, we did not think about image size. The average image we posted to the blog was between 2 and 8 megabytes and the resolution was over 3000 x 3000 pixels. The image below is an example.
 For most blogs, images should be less than 1000 pixels in the longest direction and preferably less than 100 kB. Featured or &amp;ldquo;hero&amp;rdquo; images can be up to 500 kB if used sparingly.</description>
